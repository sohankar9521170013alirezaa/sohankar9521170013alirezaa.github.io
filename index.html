		<p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose and a very popular programming language. Python programming language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting edge technology in Software Industry. </p>

		<p>Below are some facts about Python Programming Language:</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Python is currently the most widely used multi-purpose, high-level programming language.</li>
			<li>Python allows programming in Object-Oriented and Procedural paradigms.</li>
			<li>Python programs generally are smaller than other programming languages like Java. Programmers have to type relatively less and indentation requirement of the language, makes them readable all the time.</li>
			<li>Python language is being used by almost all tech-giant companies like – Google, Amazon, Facebook, Instagram, Dropbox, Uber… etc. </li>
			<li>The biggest strength of Python is huge collection of standard library which can be used for the following: 
				<ul>
					<li>Machine Learning</li>
					<li>GUI Applications (like Kivy, Tkinter, PyQt etc. )</li>
					<li>Web frameworks like Django (used by YouTube, Instagram, Dropbox)</li>
					<li>Image processing (like OpenCV, Pillow)</li>
					<li>Web scraping (like Scrapy, BeautifulSoup, Selenium)</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Input/Output</h2>
		<p>Developers often have a need to interact with users, either to get data or to provide some sort of result. Most programs today use a dialog box as a way of asking the user to provide some type of input. While Python provides us with two inbuilt functions to read the input from the keyboard.</p>

		</br>

		<h2>Operators</h2>
		<p>Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.</p>

		</br>

		<h2>Data Types</h2>
		<p>In the previous article, we read about basics of Python. Now, we continue with some more python concepts.</p>	

		<h3>Python String</h3>
		<p>In Python, Strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. However, Python does not have a character data type, a single character is simply a string with a length of 1. Square brackets can be used to access elements of the string.</p>

		<h3>Python Lists</h3>
		<p>Lists are just like dynamic sized arrays, declared in other languages (vector in C++ and ArrayList in Java). Lists need not be homogeneous always which makes it a most powerful tool in Python. A single list may contain DataTypes like Integers, Strings, as well as Objects. Lists are mutable, and hence, they can be altered even after their creation.</p>
